- 👋 Howdy, @username-garb0 here.
- 👀 I’m interested in writing tools for web things using my phone for Brain Reasons. Cheapmaxxing good, ease of access good.
- 💭 I really, really want to use lisp for at least one project. Just to try it out, ya know? I think it is a neat language (may have worms in my brain, idk)
- 📝 Using things "wrong" is important too
- 🌱 Currently messing around in termux & generally grumbling about hosting costing money
- 🛠️ Way more Hardware Person than web dev. Electronics/EE tech/hardware functional testing background. PIC stan 🙂‍↔️
- 📫 How to reach me: 🕳️ <- holler real big!!
- 😵‍💫 Pronouns: she/they, any
